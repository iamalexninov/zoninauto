# ZONIN DEALERSHIP
Welcome to Zonin Dealershipâ€”a dynamic project within my programmer portfolio. This web application aims to provide a seamless and user-friendly platform for car enthusiasts and potential buyers. Zonin Dealership showcases an extensive inventory of vehicles, offering a smooth browsing experience to explore various models, specifications, and pricing. Built with a focus on intuitive design and functionality, this project demonstrates my skills in web development, aiming to create an engaging and informative space for those in search of their dream vehicle.

# Tech Stack
Zonin Dealership is built on React for the frontend and Express for robust server operations. Leveraging ContextAPI in React for state management, along with CSS Modules for styling, this project ensures a responsive interface coupled with secure functionalities. Utilizing Mongoose, Jsonwebtoken, and Bcrypt, it delivers seamless database interactions, authentication, and security measures. Witness the synergy of React's dynamic interface with Express's backend prowess in this modern car dealership platform.

```React, ContextApi, CSS Modules, NodeJS/ExpressJS, Mongoose, Bcrypt, JSONWEBTOKEN and more.```

# For Future Thinking
> Expand the Project - each user can be a dealer or normal user, that means users can sell or buy cars. Each User will have his/her own account, where he/she can sell his cars. Users will have two options when they create an account, normal user(buyer) or dealer(seller).

> Adding Shop for Auto parts.

> Making adds for each Car, using viographers and photographers.

> Creating a detailing center for cleaning each car.
